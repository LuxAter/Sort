\section{Comparison Sorts}\label{sec:comparison_sorts}

Comparison sorting algorithms, are algortims that directly compare the
entrys of the set of items to be sorted. This means that each item is
checked against one another and depending on the check, these items may be
swaped to further the order of the array of items, untill the array is
compleatly sorted. These sorting algorithms are some of the msot common,
becbecause it is fairly simple to implement, and to theoreticaly think of.

This means that there is a large number of compairson sorts, that are
commonlcommonly used in the world of computer science. Some of the most
commocommon are Bubble sort, Quicksort or Merge sort. One aspect of
compaisoncompaison sort algorithms is that they tend to use less memory,
thanthan that of non comparison sorting algorithms, because the comparison
sotrs tend to swap the elements of the list in place, insetead of creating
new lists, and copying. However, they tend to be limited because they are
dirdirrectly comparing each elemnt to one another.
